# Notes'nync Android Alpha 0.1.0

This is a heavy-testing alpha build. Do not use it as the only copy of important notes, attachments, workspace data, or sync-chain content.

## Included

- Android package `com.notesnync.app` with Notes'nync branding.
- HTML-backed animated loading screen from the packaged Notes'nync logo animation.
- Room-backed notes, tasks, workspaces, files metadata, chat, canvas, settings, vault, backups, and sync snapshots.
- Page/source/preview note editor with inline image/file/note embeds and markdown preview.
- AppFlowy/Trello-inspired task board with boards, columns, Board/List/Table/Calendar/Timeline/Chart views, persisted manual order, long-press card movement, and animated board interactions.
- Google Drive API sync path using Android OAuth client metadata and `appDataFolder`.
- Demo Privacy Policy and Terms pages under `docs/` for GitHub Pages hosting.

## Known Alpha Risks

- This is not release-signed.
- Real-device OAuth, keyboard behavior, canvas gestures, and dense-board drag behavior still need device validation.
- Back up manually before testing sync, import, export, vault, or attachment workflows.
